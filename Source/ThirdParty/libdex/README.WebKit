This directory contains a copy of libdex from the official repository.

  - URL: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libdex

The simplest way of updating its contents is to re-create the directory
from scratch, and restoring the needed files with Git. Example commands:

  rm -rf Source/ThirdParty/libdex
  cp -ar ../path/to/libdex Source/ThirdParty/
  git checkout -- \
      Source/ThirdParty/libdex/README.WebKit \
      Source/ThirdParty/libdex/CMakeLists.txt \
      Source/ThirdParty/libdex/cmake-config.h.i
  rm -rf Source/ThirdParty/libdex/.git/
  git add -A Source/ThirdParty/libdex/

Then check whether the updated sources require any changes to the CMake build
system, and update the libdex commit identifier (and tag, if applicable) in
this file.
